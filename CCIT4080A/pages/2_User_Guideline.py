Navigate to the ‘Movenet Model Select’ dropdown menu. 

You can choose between 'Movenet lightning (float 16)', 'Movenet lightning (int 8)', 'Movenet thunder (float 16)', or 'Movenet thunder (int 8)'. 

The 'lightning' models are optimized for speed, while 'thunder' models are optimized for accuracy. 

We suggest starting with 'Movenet lightning (float 16)' for a balance between speed and accuracy.

Adjust the 'Confidence Threshold' slider to set the sensitivity of the posture detection. 

This will determine how strictly the software judges your plank form. 

For the best results, we suggest setting the confidence threshold between 0.3 to 0.4. 

This range offers a balance, providing accurate feedback without being overly sensitive to minor deviations.

Set Up Your Space: 

Ensure you are in a well-lit area where your whole body can be seen by the camera. 

The camera should be placed at a distance where your entire body is visible, from head to toe. 

This helps in accurately capturing your posture during the plank exercise. 

Align the Camera: 

Adjust the camera so it is level with your body to provide a clear, straight-on view of your posture.

Get into Position: 

Start the plank exercise by positioning your forearms on the ground.

Maintain Proper Form: 

Keep your back straight, your buttocks in line with your shoulders, and your head facing down.

Non-Standard vs. Standard vs. Missing:

A high "Standard" percentage indicates that your plank closely aligns with the ideal form. 

Conversely, a high "Non-Standard" percentage suggests that adjustments are needed for correct posture.

X and Y Coordinates:

Per Key Point:
 
Next to each key point, you will find a 'confidence threshold' score, showing how confident the model is that it has correctly detected and positioned that key point. 

A higher score signifies greater confidence. 

For example, if the 'left shoulder' key point has a high confidence threshold score, it means the model is quite certain it has located your left shoulder accurately. 

If the score is low, the model is less certain, and it may indicate that you are positioning in relation to the camera needs adjusting or that your form is incorrect
